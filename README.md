Rake (Tool) – Pick Up Leaf Litter Quicker

I got so annoyed by leaf litter, I spent hours making this mod instead of just ignoring them like a normal person. Now you can craft rakes to scoop up leaf litter and dead bushes in big chunks. Iron does a 3x3 area, gold 5x5, diamond 7x7, and netherite clears a glorious 9x9. It’s overkill. You’re welcome.
Features:

🧹 Craftable Rakes - Clean up leaf litter and dead bushes in bulk with four glorious tiers:

    Iron Rake – Clears a 3×3 area.
    Golden Rake – Clears a 5×5 area.
    Diamond Rake – Clears a 7×7 area.
    Netherite Rake – Clears a ridiculous 9×9 area. Completely unnecessary. Absolutely satisfying.

🍂 Mass Cleanup Made Easy

    Rakes instantly remove leaf piles and dead bushes around the block you target. Just right-click, and watch nature get obliterated.

💎 No Durability

    Rakes never break. They're eternal. Like our resentment toward leaf litter.

🏜️ Also Works on Dead Bushes

    Because why stop at leaves? Desert players, we see you.
